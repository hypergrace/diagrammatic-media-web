# grace grace grace

# artist statement

I am an installation and performance artist working with real-time sonic and visual computational media. I create art foregrounding processes that challenge reactionary habits of thought and create new potentials for feeling, thinking, and acting with the non-human world. I am interested in experiential media (sound, projection, light) because of their ability to take us out of what we thought we knew about the world and into the present unfolding of reality. I develop my own hardware and software because it allows for audiences to experience unfamiliar blocks of time and texture that cut across human gesturality and non-human rhythmicity and expressivity. My performance and installation work has been shown at the Kennedy Center, at Goldsmiths in London, The National Academy of Sciences, and artist-run spaces across the US. In the next five years I want to continue recent work developing custom hardware and speakers that allows my sound work to have a larger physical extension. 

# teaching and organizing

I teach media theory-philosophy seminars as well as studio courses in the Art Technology / Sound Practices department at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and in the new media area at the University of Illinois Chicago.

In 2023, I co-found [CCAM, the Center for Concrete and Abstract Machines](https://ccam.world).

# short performer bio

Grace grace grace (performing as hypergrace) is an artist working at the busy intersection of process philosophy, computational media systems, and cybernetics. He leverages training in cello performance to create generative sound + medja installations and performances luring encounters with perception, thinking, and feeling. Grace writes and assembles software / hardware systems with indeterminate logics aiming to create play in the unforeseeable unpredictabilities of the aesthetic event.
