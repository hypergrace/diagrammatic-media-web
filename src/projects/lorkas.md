From 2013 to 2015, I directed the student-led Laptop Orchestra of Arizona State. We created DIY and nomadic immersive media environments for the performance of member-composed pieces. As a group of five-fifteen, we performed extensively around Phoenix, Flagstaff, and even received funding to fly to Ames, IOWA to perform at a meeting of A2RU. My last major project as director was producing our only album, NODES, which we released as a cassette.

Directing LORKAS was formative in my research interests; making music and performing together became a laboratory for asking questions about collaboration and coordination. It also revealed my interest in honing skills as a leader who could be responsive and supportive of a collective. Our access to university resources was a great and temporary privilege; I made great efforts to incorporate diverse practices and to make the group open to performers and composers in the Tempe and Phoenix experimental music scenes.

I learned to make use of resources available to me; as a student group we were able to invite important and influential guests to speak, give workshops, and collaborate with, including Mark Hosler of Negativland, computer musician Stephen David Beck, LA-based designer and noise musician John Wiese, and composer and Cycling 74 developed Tim Place.

In groups of 5-15, we performed regularly around the Southwest including: the 2014 Southwest Electronic Music Festival, the 2015 Southwest Maker Festival, the 2015 [Oh My Ears](https://www.ohmyears.org/) new music marathon, Glendale Community College's Experimental Music Festival 2015. We also performed on Phoenix's Fox 10 Saturday morning show.

My compositions for laptop orchestra were also performed at the Cincinnati Contemporary Arts Center and in Athens, Ohio.
