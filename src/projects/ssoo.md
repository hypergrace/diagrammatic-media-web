In May 2015, digital fabricator and designer Matthew Briggs created the experimental arts and performance festival SSOO [something said only once] as a way of creating exchange between the fledgling arts scenes in the not-so-distant cities of Flagstaff and Phoenix. We met four Fridays in a row with artists gleaned from a call for proposals for workshops, performances, installations, wall work, and more.

The name of the festival comes from the literary term 'hapax legomenon', a word that appears only once, and invited participating artists to consider the ephemorality of their work and the events it created.
