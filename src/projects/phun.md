From 2016 to 2020 I co-organized the reading group and conference series PHuN (post-human network). The peer-reviewed conference invited keynotes including Marcel O'Gorman, Kavita Philip, Thierry Bardini, Phillip Thurtle, and Sha Xin Wei. Our conferences convened speakers from around the United States, Canada, the UK, and Germany.
